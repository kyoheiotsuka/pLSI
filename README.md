# probablistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI)

Implementation of probablistic Latent Semantic Indexing using EM algorithm is provided in this class.
For details on pLSI, please refer to the original paper [probablistic latent semantic analysis](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6705.pdf) and/or article on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_latent_semantic_analysis).

## Sample Code

Sample code is available for applying pLSI and extracting topics from synthetically generated data.
Figures below show the obtained results after observing 1000 synthetically generated data.
